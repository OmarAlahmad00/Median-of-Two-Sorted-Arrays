# Median-of-Two-Sorted-Arrays

This was my attempt at the Leetcode "Median of Two Sorted Arrays" problem. I realised that everything had to be in one function. In the last coding problem I was confused as to why my code was not being accepted after submission even though my output was correct but I know realise it is because everything has to be in one function.
